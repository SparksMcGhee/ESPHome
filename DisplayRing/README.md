# Display Ring 
### Background
Bought a nice display light which had an LED ring on it

Hated that its in-line controller always defaulted to off when the light was plugged in, making it impossible to automate or switch elsewhere.  

Replaced the in-line controller with a D1 mini I had lying around so I could control via Home Assistant. 

### For next time
I'd wire in one of my new favorite devices: a SW-18010P vibration sensor: 
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07S8HGL31 so I could tap the controller to turn on-and-off the light. 

I love vibration sensors more then buttons because you don't have to mount a button or make it easy to use, just tapping the device is enough to trigger it. 

As an added bonus earthquakes will result in my home going full-on lightswitch rave. 

### What sucked
None of my transisters had a low enough voltage floor to work with the D1's 3.3v logic voltage. Spent hours digging through my hacker space's boxes of loose misc. electrical componenets trying to find something that suites. 

I now keep a pack of 3.3v logic NPN transisters around.
